## Deployment

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a
deployment target, you only need to
[import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be
deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory
by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will
then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its
[Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).
